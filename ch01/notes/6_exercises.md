## Exercises

1. Create a new virtual environment using `python3 -m venv`.
2. Practice activating and deactivating your virtual environment a few times.
3. Install pytest in your new virtual environment. 
4. Create a few test files. You can use the ones we used in this chapter or make up your own. Practice running pytest against these files.
5. Change the assert statements.  
   Donâ€™t just use `assert something == something_else`.  
   Try things like:
  * `assert 1 in [2, 3, 4]`
  * `assert a < b`
  * `assert 'fizz' not in 'fizzbuzz'`
